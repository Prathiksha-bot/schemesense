# SchemeSense

SchemeSense is an AI-powered assistant designed to help Indian citizens easily discover, understand, and apply for government welfare schemes.

Millions of people miss out on benefits simply because information is scattered across multiple portals, written in complex language, or hard to find. SchemeSense solves this by providing a simple, trustworthy, and personalized way to access scheme information.

## Problem
- Government scheme information is fragmented across many websites.
- Eligibility criteria are complex and difficult to understand.
- Rural citizens, elderly users, and people with low digital literacy struggle to access benefits.

## Solution
SchemeSense allows users to:
- Ask questions in simple language (and local languages).
- Check eligibility automatically.
- Get step-by-step guidance on how to apply.
- Receive reminders and updates about relevant schemes.

## Technology (Planned)
- Large Language Model (LLM) for understanding queries.
- Retrieval system using government scheme databases.
- Natural Language Processing for regional languages.
- Web or mobile interface for easy access.

## Impact
- Increases awareness and adoption of welfare schemes.
- Reduces dependency on middlemen.
- Helps governments improve scheme reach and transparency.

## Status
Currently in idea and early prototype phase for hackathon submission.
